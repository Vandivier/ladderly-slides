# Overview

According to Ladderly's [job search best practices](https://github.com/Vandivier/ladderly-slides#job-search), when trying to obtain an interview, among other times,
it is advantageous to message other professionals.

This document includes scripts that you can use to message other professionals.
This document also includes a variety of job search tips, such as the three strikes rule for application follow-up.

It's a good idea to tailor the language in these scripts to your specific situation,
but if you are uncomfortable with the risk introduced by modifying them you can also use them as-is.
Specific scripts are given for talking to individuals in three roles: other engineers, managers, and recruiters.

The goal of these scripts is to improve the odds of achieving any of several positive outcomes, including:

1. Obtaining an interview
2. Obtaining a new LinkedIn social connection
3. Obtaining a referral or reference
4. Obtaining general advice to facilitate job search, career growth, portfolio improvement, or skill improvement

Here's an outline of the scripts that are currently contained in this document:

1. SWE Scripts
    1. Request for Portfolio Review
    2. Clarify Technical Practices
2. Manager Scripts
    1. Request for Resume Review
    2. Clarify Culture and Performance Review Practices
3. Recruiter Scripts
    1. Request for Resume Review
    2. Request for Other Contacts
4. Follow-Up Script Preface, the Three Strikes Rule
5. Follow-Up Script

## SWE Scripts, Request for Portfolio Review

Hi [CONTACT NAME]! I am applying for a role at [TARGET COMPANY] and I see you work there.

I see y'all use [SOME TECH] and I have used that in my portfolio.

Would you be willing to take a look at the code in this repo?

[PASTE REPO LINK]

I'm looking to see whether I'm using [SOME TECH] in a way that would be viewed as competent by engineers at the company.

I would love to know if there are any changes you recommend, missing libraries, etc., thanks!

### SWE Scripts, Request for Portfolio Review, Post-Activities

1. If the engineer responds at all, even to decline a review, thank them for their time and send a connection request.
2. If the engineer recommends edits, thank them and make the edits.
3. If the engineer says the projects looks good, or if you have made recommended changes, do thank them for their time, ask for a referral, and send a connection request.

## SWE Scripts, Clarify Technical Practices

Hi [CONTACT NAME]! I am applying for a role at [TARGET COMPANY] and I see you work there.

I see y'all use [SOME TECH], but I want to learn more about the specific way it's being used.

Would you be open to a 15 minute zoom call where we can chat more about that and some other tech details?

### SWE Scripts, Clarify Technical Practices, Post-Activities

1. After your zoom call, send a LinkedIn connection request
2. If you have a project using some of the tech at the target company, you can quickly review during the zoom call or ask for an offline review
3. If the engineer expresses satisfaction with the tech, ask if they would consider being a reference or referral at the company

## Manager Scripts, Request for Resume Review

Hi [CONTACT NAME]! I just applied for [JOB POST TITLE] at [TARGET COMPANY] and I see that you are a manager there.

Would you mind taking a look at my attached resume? I believe I'm qualified for the role but I'm not sure that my resume is well-made.

If you have recommended edits or other general advice for applying at [TARGET COMPANY], I'd love to hear!

This is in reference to the below job posting. Thank you!

### Manager Scripts, Request for Resume Review, Post-Activities

1. If the manager responds at all, even to decline a review, thank them for their time and send a connection request.
2. If the manager recommends edits, thank them and make the edits.
3. I do not recommend that you specifically ask the manager for a reference, referral, or preferential treatment. Simply trust that if they liked the resume they will already be working to prioritize your candidacy.

## Manager Scripts, Clarify Culture and Performance Review Practices

Hi [CONTACT NAME]! I'm applying for [JOB POST TITLE] at [TARGET COMPANY] and I see you are a manager there.

Would you be open to a 15 minute zoom call?

Company culture and performance review process are two important factors for me as I look for my next role.

As a manager, would you have context to share on the topic, or could you recommend a better resource/contact?

Thanks in advance! By the way, I specifically applied for the below role:

## Recruiter Scripts, Request for Resume Review

Hi [CONTACT NAME]! I'm applying for [JOB POST TITLE] at [TARGET COMPANY] and I see you are a recruiter there.

Would you mind checking on my application and resume? I'm wondering:

1. Would you recommend any changes to improve my resume?

3. What is the normal response time for an application like this?

Thank you so much! Here's the specific role that I applied to:

### Recruiter Scripts, Request for Resume Review, Post-Activities

1. If the recruiter responds at all, even to decline, thank them for their time and send a connection request.
2. If they do suggest someone, reach out to the other person once or twice. If you get no response, let the recruiter know.
3. If they suggest someone and you had a positive interaction with the other person, let the recruiter know.

## Follow-Up Script Preface, the Three Strikes Rule

Ladderly recommends the three strikes rule for application follow-up. The three strikes rule itself has three pieces, described below.

### Three Strikes for a Role, not a Contact

This rule indicates that an individual should follow up three times before declining a job due to lack of employer responsiveness.

It is often inappropriate or suboptimal to message the same individual three times. Following up on a single job post three times may indicate two messages to a recruiter and one message to a hiring manager, for example.

Similarly, an unresponsive engineer may simply not be a frequent social media user. Following up with the engineer three times on the same role is not effective and possibly annoying.

Do follow up once with an unresponsive contact, but do message a different contact if the original contact remains unresponsive after a follow-up message.

Do note that the cadance of follow-up is important. Message only once per week. You may message once the same day that you apply, and you can even message two or three people on that same day, but do not follow up with a single contact until the following week and a minimum of three business days have elapsed.

For example, if I apply on a Friday, I can message a contact on the same day, but I should not follow up until the following Wednesday at the earliest. I should also not wait until after the following Friday to follow up.

### Three Strikes for a Company

Ladderly recommends applying for only one or two roles at a particular company at a time.

In rare cases, two roles may close out within the same job search, and the candidate may be eligible to apply again.

In these cases, do feel free to apply for more roles at that company, but Ladderly recommends a caveat: If the employer is unresponsive on three roles during a job search, reduce priority of applications at this employer.

### Three Strikes to Restore a Company

If an employer has been deprioritized for unresponsiveness, let's not deprioritize them for all time. Companies do change over time.

Remove deprioritization from an employer after the shorter time window among two options:

1. Eighteen Months
2. Three Job Search Cycles

On a related note, Ladderly recommends considering a new job search every six months, if for no other reason than to maintain interview skill.
