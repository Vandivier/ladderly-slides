# Endorsed Communities

Ladderly suggests these communities to expedite your social networking journey.

## Suggested Use

Social networking can be useful for learning, the job search, and more.

As a best practice, leverage your social media presence to build in public. Start with a 2:1 ratio where you code for at least one hour per day and engage on social media for at least thirty minutes each day, with a focus on discussing technical topics.

If you have yet to land your first coding job:

1. Don't try to engage deeply with all of these communities to the neglect of other important tasks.
2. Instead, try out various communities and see who you resonate with.
3. After a week of experimenting, pick the top 1 or 2 communities that you would like to grow with.
4. Spend a minimum of 5-10 minutes per day chatting with your selected groups.
5. After you land your job, do try out more groups later on! ðŸ˜Š Continuously explore and experiment to prevent knowledge silos, increases growth, and fosters diversity.

Specifically, ensure that you are posting on:

1. GitHub
2. LinkedIn
3. Twitter
4. TikTok
    1. If you have extra cash, use [repurpose.io](https://repurpose.io/?aff=98821) to multi-post on YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels.
5. Discord

As always, experiment and adjust your time allocations to maximize your personal results.
