# Endorsed Communities

Endorsed communities are groups of people that Ladderly officially recommends.

For some such communities, this document also provides guidelines on when and how to engage such communities.

## FreeCodeCamp Community

Ladderly and DevCrew are both similar in spirit to FreeCodeCamp.

All of these communities share a mission to help make software and the tech industry accessible to all.

FreeCodeCamp is a large community. Here are a few key entrypoints into that community:

1. [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
2. [FreeCodeCamp YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/Freecodecamp)
3. [FreeCodeCamp Discord](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/freecodecamp-discord-chat-room-server/)

## Endorsed Diversity-Oriented Communities

1. [FaithTech](https://faithtech.com/)
2. [Girls Who Code](https://girlswhocode.com/)
    1. Also consider [Black Girls Code](https://www.blackgirlscode.com/)
3. [Blacks In Technology](https://www.blacksintechnology.net/)
    1. Also consider [Black Girls Code](https://www.blackgirlscode.com/)
4. [Latinas in Tech](https://latinasintech.org/)
    1. Note: I'm looking for feedback on a few other hispanic D&I communities that I may eventually recommend:
    2. Techqueria
    3. TechLatino
