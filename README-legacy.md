<!-- TODO: why react and why javascript could be two different sections -->

### Why React?

1. [React and JavaScript are Full-Stack Technologies.](https://www.tiktok.com/@johnvandivier/video/6990381670717263109) <!-- .element: target="_blank" -->
    - Python is a server-side language. This supports comparatively fewer use cases.
2. [The mental model for web development is already familiar to most people.](https://www.tiktok.com/@johnvandivier/video/6990694910596746502) <!-- .element: target="_blank" -->

---

### Why React?

3. [AI and ML use cases for Python are not beginner-friendly.](https://www.tiktok.com/@johnvandivier/video/6990869073198583046) <!-- .element: target="_blank" -->
    1. AI and ML may be dangerous when used by developers that don't understand statistics.
4. Why Learn React instead of Angular?
    1. [Job availability](https://www.tiktok.com/@johnvandivier/video/6994104033115950341) <!-- .element: target="_blank" -->
    2. [Same for Flutter, Svelte, Vue, and others](https://www.tiktok.com/@johnvandivier/video/6994165996957207813) <!-- .element: target="_blank" -->
    3. [React Native has special cross-platform uses](https://www.tiktok.com/@johnvandivier/video/6994519065960189190) <!-- .element: target="_blank" -->

       [2020](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020)<!-- .element: target="_blank" -->,
       [2021](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021)<!-- .element: target="_blank" -->,
       and more
    2. React is the most popular and loved web framework

---

### Why React?

    1. React can be written using JavaScript or TypeScript
    2. JavaScript and TypeScript are multi-paradigm
    3. React, JS, and TS are cross-platform, full-stack technologies with many use cases
    4. TypeScript as a language is highly loved and wanted by developers

---

### Why React?

7. Most people don't intend to work in data science
    1. Python is associated with a data science niche
    2. React has more results in a refined job search that excludes data engineering roles
    3. AI, ML, server-side, and non-graphical programs are not intuitive for most people
8. Websites and mobile apps involve a familar mental model

<!-- python -data -javascript -node.js -->
<!-- TODO: have a source -->
<!-- 2. Python has more job postings than JavaScript in a naive Indeed.com search -->
<!-- 3. Python is also multi-paradigm -->
<!-- 5. As a result, React is a best-fit for most aspirational software engineers -->

---

### Why React?

9. [More beginner friendly than C++](https://www.tiktok.com/@johnvandivier/video/7003353891140095237)<!-- .element: target="_blank" -->

    1. Python and JavaScript considered beginner friendly. C++ and many other langs are not.
    2. With JavaScript, we don't have to manually manage memory
    3. React can be gradually learned, implemented, and adopted

---

### Why React?

10. [More beginner friendly than C++](https://www.tiktok.com/@johnvandivier/video/7003353891140095237)<!-- .element: target="_blank" -->

### Why a Coaching Program?

#### Comparing Colleges, Bootcamps, Coaches, and Self-Teaching

1. You get maximum ROI if you can effectively and rapidly self-teach.
2. Try self-teaching by taking the free [Codecademy Learn HTML course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html).<!-- .element: target="_blank" -->
3. Given the results of this test, other options might be recommended.

---

### Why a Coaching Program?

#### When to Prefer Self-Teaching

1. Prefer self-teaching by default.
2. If you didn't enjoy the self-teaching experiment earlier described, consider another option.
3. If you don't have a job after 12 months, this is a sign that you should consider other options.
4. If you don't want to invest up to 12 months in self-teaching, other options might get you job ready sooner.

---

### When to Prefer a Bootcamp

1. You find [a prestigious bootcamp](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3835966) that has acceptable terms.<!-- .element: target="_blank" -->
    - Check the price, payment options, refund policy, technologies taught, and course schedule.
2. You qualify for admission.
    - Note that quality bootcamp prep is also available, [here for example](https://www.appacademy.io/course/bootcamp-prep-online).<!-- .element: target="_blank" -->

---

### Why a Coaching Program?

### When to Prefer Coaching or Mentorship

1. You already have a career and you are seeking to level-up.
2. You need help getting references or referrals.
3. You want social learning, but you don't want a bootcamp.
    - For example, learning at a bootcamps might lack personalization, be too fast, too slow, or have unacceptable terms.
4. You are already in a bootcamp or college program, but you want additional help.

---

### Why a Coaching Program?

#### When to Prefer College

1. If other options don't work, consider this as a fallback plan.
2. If you are able to complete college at a reasonable price and within a reasonable period of time.
    - Many employers will subsidize or entirely pay for college. Consider [Guild Education partners](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Guild_Education&oldid=1060668579).
    - Certain individuals may qualify for unique scholarships.
    - Don't forget to include opportunity cost in your college price analysis!

---

### Why a Coaching Program?

#### When to Prefer College

3. If a slower pace of learning is ideal for you
    - Specifically, you want longer than 1 year to learn to code.
4. You already have a career, but a degree could help you advance
    - Undergraduate and graduate degrees may help you advance into management
    - Earning a degree may appear positive on your corporate performance review

---

<!-- in common: employers see tech skills

-   employers see soft skill deficit
-   some learning providers are just bad

differences:

1. college has a long learning horizon (5 year average), lower educational spend ROI, higher cost, debt load
   a. however, it's kind of changing Guild Education partners with Walmart, Target, Amazon, and others...to offer totally free college to all associates, even part-time
   b. but it does help
2. bootcamps are fast, cheaper
   a. 1-size-fits-all-pace
   b. teachers and career services are often non-senior dev quality themselves
3. self-teaching can be great, but you need to be smart and self-driven (not many are)
   a. you can get stuck in tutorial hell
   b. you can miss major concepts without realizing it and end up taking even longer to land your first job
   c. can be free out-of-pocket, but don't ignore time costs!
4. coaching costs money
   a. can do deferred payment
   b. can tailor learning to your speed: faster, slower
   c. can supplement with coaching, it doesn't have to be by itself

ladderly plug: focus on skills and job search techniques not taught elsewhere!
focus on tech skills in highest salary and employability: (namely React.js)

### Why a Coaching Program?

1. [You're able to leverage your mentor's social network.](https://www.tiktok.com/@johnvandivier/video/6992669586650909957)<!-- .element: target="_blank" -->
2. [How to Identify a Quality Coach](https://www.tiktok.com/@johnvandivier/video/7004185744801582341)
    1. Bulk discount on hours
    2. Offers a job guarantee
    3. Are they where you want to be?
    4. Are they asking you to do something they have never done?

    3. Help practice interviews
    4. Help you learn better by accelerating and decelerating pace of learning, tailored to you
    5. Can help you find and learn the latest tech, instead of learning a fixed curriculum optimized for a prior point in time.

---

### Googling Techniques

[Source: Fireship, "How to 'Google It' like a Senior Software Engineer"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEBkvm0-rg0) <!-- .element: target="_blank" -->

1. If you run into a code error or log message, try literally searching the message.
2. Refine search using double-quotes for an exact match.

---

### Googling Techniques

3. Increase useful results by removing application-specific content in your search
4. Use the "site:" prefix to search for results within a single site, eg `site:stackoverflow.com`
5. Use the minus sign to exclude web pages that include a keyword

---

### Googling Techniques

6. Refine by searching over a specific time period
7. You can use the "filetype:" prefix to search for specific file types
8. If a search result isn't currently accessible, try to access a cached version
9. Try using search engines other than Google as appropriate. For example, you could search within StackOverflow.

# TODO: FIX README BELOW THIS POINT

outlining the job search:

1. have a portfolio (should be done by the time you get to job search)
2. make sure your resume looks good
3. make sure you are on social media, and your socials look presentable (particularly LinkedIn)
4. blast resume - (to who? to what job titles&descriptions? where? how many in a blast...indeed+linkedIn+https://www.theladders.com/ for job search; there are also a variety of programming-specific platforms like Vettery)
5. follow up with corporate recruiters at target companies; that is, SOCIAL NETWORK
6. attending meetups, conferences, and participating on social media (Twitter Spaces, tiktok, of course commenting on people's linkedIn conversations w/e)
7. interview technique - coding, algorithm, behavioral, system design

---

### Antipatterns

The value of these activities is expected to be negative net of opportunity cost, in particular when placed as a required step prior to landing the first software development role.

1. [Fullstack.Cafe](https://www.fullstack.cafe/interview-questions/cap-theorem) for job prep is expensive and trivia-focused. Likely to be unhelpful net of opportunity cost for interview prep.
2. [Interview Cake](https://www.moonchaser.io/post/leetcode-premium-vs-algoexpert-vs-interview-cake-vs-hackerrank-comparison) for DS&A adds no value compared to Leetcode + AlgoExpert. AlgoExpert's high-quality video makes it preferred over Interview Cake.
3. Prioritizing generators, redux-saga, css-grid, or frameworks other than React or Angular.

---

TODO

1. Behavioral Interview prep
2. clean up readme
3. record all lessons and publish non-free course (or release standard course as free)
4. We know about social networking, but what about recommended meetups and conferences?
5. more resources: logrocket podcast, jason lengstorf
